My PhD has followed a very nonlinear path. These graphics illustrate the evolution of my academic and professional interests over time. Some elements reflect subjects I formally analyzed in my research, while others represent transitional topics-â€”areas where I spent considerable time surveying and understanding a field to indentify gaps and links to other fields, even if I didn't make a formal contribution myself.
